# Modmon Documentation

Documentation for [Modmon](https://github.com/modmonhq/modmon) - a simplified deployment system for small/medium teams with a GitOps-focused approach.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

**These docs are very much a work-in-progress.** Modmon is currently in pre-alpha development, and this documentation site is being actively developed alongside the project.

## 📝 Doc-Driven Development

Modmon follows a **doc-driven development** approach. This means:

- Documentation is written first to define features and workflows
- A complete suite of docs will guide and kickoff each development cycle
- The docs serve as both specification and user guide

This approach ensures that features are well-thought-out and user-focused before implementation begins.

## 🛠️ Development

This site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

```
