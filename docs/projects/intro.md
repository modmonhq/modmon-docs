# Intro to projects

Projects fundamentally include everything you need to get a stack off the ground. This includes:

- Repositories (stored in [depot](depot/intro.md))
- Clusters (can be [outsourced to another repo](/docs/clusters/storage-locations/cluster-repos.md))
- [Access control](/docs/access-control/intro.md) lists
- Deployment instructions
