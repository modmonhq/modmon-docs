# Community Recipes

:::info[Upcoming]
The "Community Recipes" functionality is an upcoming feature.
:::

Just like [Prefabs](/docs/tutorial/blueprints/prefabs.md), Community Recipes are community-contributed recipe templates that can be used to quickly create a deploy pipeline.

Community Recipes in the future may include pipelines, such as a "Generate Static Site" recipe that can be used to turn any static-site-generating repo into a fully-functioning stack, deployed with a single command.

More information coming soon.
