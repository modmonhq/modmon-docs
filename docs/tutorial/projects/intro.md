# Intro to projects

Projects fundamentally include everything you need to get a stack off the ground. This includes:

- [Blueprints](/docs/tutorial/blueprints/intro.md) (Services, databases, etc.)
  - This includes repositories (stored in [depot](docs/tutorial/projects/depot/intro.md))
- [Recipes](/docs/tutorial/recipes/intro.md) (Deployment instructions)
- [Clusters](/docs/tutorial/clusters/intro.md) (can be [outsourced to another repo](/docs/tutorial/clusters/storage-locations/cluster-repos.md))
- [Access control](/docs/tutorial/access-control/intro.md) lists
