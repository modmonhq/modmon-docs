# Intro to blueprints

Bluerprints are a way to define what your stack consists of. They are a simple, declarative way to describe your app's components, services, and dependencies.

They can be created using the following tools:

- [Modmon CLI](/docs/cli/blueprints.md)
- [Modmon UI](/docs/ui/blueprints.md)
- Editing the yaml files directly

At the end, they are compiled to a docker-compose.yaml or docker-stack.yaml file, which is used by Modmon to deploy your app.
