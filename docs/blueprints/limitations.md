# Limitations

In the earliest versions of Modmon, changing a Blueprint will require a complete rebuild of the stack (involving ungraceful downtime). We reccomend not changing them too often or dramatically on production systems.

A future update will allow Blueprint migrations - gently transforming what's in a Blueprint into a new Blueprint.
