# Prefabs

:::info[Upcoming]
The "Prefabs" functionality is an upcoming feature.
:::

Prefabs are community-contributed blueprint templates that can be used to quickly create a stack.

A prefab may be tech-specific, such as a "Laravel" prefab, or it may be a more general template, such as a "PHP" prefab. For the JS folks - it could be a "Next.js" prefab or a more generic "Node" prefab.

More information coming soon.
